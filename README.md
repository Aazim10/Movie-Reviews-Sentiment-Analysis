# Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis
In this notebbok, I've used an IMDB dataset of 50k movie reviews available on Kaggle. The dataset contains 2 columns (review and sentiment) that will help us identify whether a review is positive or negative.

The goal is to find which model is best suited to predict sentiment (output) given a movie review (input).
